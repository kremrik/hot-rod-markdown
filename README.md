Soup-up your Markdown!

### Motivation
Markdown is God's gift to technical writers.
It's easy to understand, always human-readable, and has the internet-equivalent [lifespan](https://brandur.org/fragments/graceful-degradation-time) of styrofoam.
For these reasons (and many more), it's a fantastic medium for communication.
`hrm` exists simply to make Markdown even more usable.
It does this by 
1. offering great quality-of-life functionality right out of the box
1. offering a simple (and easy) plugin model for rapid extensions
